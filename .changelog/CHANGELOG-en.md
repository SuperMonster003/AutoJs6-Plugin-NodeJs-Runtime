# v1.2.0

###### 2026/08/29

* `Feature` Added `capabilities()` to the `mediainfo` facade and explicit plugin snapshot v1/v2 selection to its callable entry and `read()`; omitting schema continues to return the existing host-owned Node v1 snapshot
* `Feature` Added module-source provider v3 for on-demand compilation of runtime-created `.ts/.mts/.cts` through byte- and SHA-256-bound PFDs, with an independent 30 s compilation budget, stable path/symlink/ambiguity rejection, and host TypeScript diagnostics plus Source Map stack mapping
* `Feature` Enabled desktop-like filesystem access within Android app permissions while keeping `/proc`, `/sys`, and `/dev` denied
* `Feature` Added `accessibility.swipe` and `accessibility.gesture` behind the dedicated `accessibility.gesture` capability
* `Fix` Made raw TypeScript fail closed unless the host supplies compiler output, mapped snapshot dynamic imports, and normalized generated/imported stack frames
* `Fix` Replaced the snapshot-based partial ESM adapter with the V8 native linker, fixing mutable exports that failed to update through cyclic re-exports
* `Fix` Fixed ESM imports of AutoJs6 compatibility facades and missing TypeScript suffix probes while preserving installed npm package precedence
* `Improvement` Removed the legacy regex-based TypeScript erasure fallback and its request switch; raw `.ts/.mts/.cts` now always require host compiler output
* `Improvement` Aligned the v2 host/plugin contract, capability manifests, and plugin-only runtime responsibility boundary
* `Improvement` Centralized Node.js examples, TypeScript declarations, the project wizard, runtime defaults, and host-alignment checks in the plugin repository, removing host-side Gradle switches and duplicate development assets

# v1.1.0

###### 2026/08/18

* `Feature` Added live stdout/stderr streaming and cooperative cancellation through `node::Stop`
* `Feature` Replaced BUSY rejection with a bounded serial queue of three waiters and added resident long-running script lifecycle support
* `Feature` Enabled raw Node network builtins, `worker_threads`, and `child_process` by default, and verified ten popular pure-JavaScript npm packages
* `Improvement` Added direct-run workspaces and tolerant v1..v2 module-source-provider negotiation with concise error codes and JavaScript stacks

# v1.0.0

###### 2026/07/18

* `Feature` Added the Node.js runtime plugin service with plugin ID `nodejs`, engine `nodejs`, and runtime slot `node24_5`
* `Feature` Provided the Node.js 24.5.0 native runtime through `libnode.so` and `libautojs6-node.so`
* `Feature` Ran the Node.js runtime in an independent persistent process that reuses process-global Node/V8 state while creating a fresh isolate and Environment for every execution
* `Feature` Added plugin info discovery through `org.autojs.plugin.INFO` and runtime invocation through `org.autojs.plugin.nodejs.RUNTIME`
* `Feature` Supported CommonJS/ESM source, module sources, working directory, sandbox root, environment variables, stdout/stderr result payloads, and runtime prewarm
* `Feature` Supported request-scoped workspace archive transport v2 with explicit input mapping, execution in a plugin-private workspace, output writeback, and deletion tombstone manifests without scanning the host sandbox
* `Feature` Enforced single-active, zero-queue admission with `ERR_AUTOJS6_NODE_PLUGIN_BUSY` backpressure and process-restart cancellation
* `Feature` Added host capability broker and live bridge support with runtime modules such as `autojs6:host-app-info`, `autojs6:device-info`, `autojs6:engine-info`, `autojs6:lifecycle-config`, and `autojs6:bridge-permissions`
* `Feature` Added ABI split APK builds for `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, and a `universal` APK
* `Feature` Packaged `libc++_shared.so` with the Node.js runtime libraries in split and universal APK outputs
* `Feature` Added `sample/nodejs` projects, a Node resolver diagnostic tool, and runtime build plan verification tools
* `Feature` Added localized plugin metadata, usage instructions, README, and CHANGELOG resources for Spanish, French, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, English, Simplified Chinese, Hong Kong Traditional Chinese, and Taiwan Traditional Chinese
* `Fix` Process-restart cancellation could commit a partial workspace snapshot while the runtime process was being retired
* `Fix` Workspace archive file descriptors could leak when request-contract validation or workspace materialization failed because ownership was not finalized on every exit path
* `Improvement` Exposed R5 contract metadata and diagnostics for ABI/capabilities, persistent runtime state, admission, cancellation, and dedicated-process attribution
* `Improvement` Added monotonic per-phase diagnostics for execution-source construction, bootstrap, script execution, result creation/retrieval, and per-execution cleanup, with skipped and not-applicable states distinguished
