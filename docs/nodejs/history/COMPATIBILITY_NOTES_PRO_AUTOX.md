This document compares user-visible behavior only. It is not an implementation-equivalence claim and does not infer private internals of other projects.

References last reviewed: 2026-08-20.

Current v1.2 baseline: ESM, dynamic import, controlled network/WebSocket,
native network builtins, bounded `worker_threads`, native `child_process`,
and allowlisted Java interop are stable and enabled without capability-specific
Gradle properties. Older P13/P14 paragraphs are retained as historical
comparison evidence where explicitly identified.

## Positioning

AutoJs6 exposes the AutoJs6 Safe Node Profile:

```text
Embedded Node/V8/libuv runtime
+ AutoJs6-controlled CommonJS loader
+ scoped filesystem
+ restricted builtin allowlist
+ asynchronous AutoJs bridge modules
+ packaged APK support
```

The goal is not unrestricted desktop Node.js compatibility. Scripts written for Auto.js Pro 9 or AutoX.js v7 may need adaptation.

P13-56 records migration and Pro9 comparison docs as partial. This document uses
three labels consistently:

- Pro-compatible: a Safe-profile bridge or documented Pro-profile migration path
  exists for Auto.js Pro/Rhino-style scripts.
- Desktop-compatible: a local desktop Node.js pattern has an AutoJs6-safe path,
  usually scoped by project files, explicit capabilities, or static examples.
- gated/diagnostic-only: a debug-only diagnostic, provider POC, static catalog,
  TypeScript metadata row, or stable denial exists, but normal scripts cannot
  rely on that authority.

debug-only/provider POC is not formal availability. Treat
`sample/nodejs/pro-parity-suite`, `sample/nodejs/desktop-parity-suite`, and
`profile_capabilities.d.ts` as migration evidence until a runtime promotion gate
marks the related surface as callable.

## Entry Points

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs describe:

- Rhino remains the default engine for compatibility.
- Node can be selected with a `"nodejs";` file header.
- `.node.js` and `.mjs` files use the Node engine.
- `.mjs` enables ES Module behavior.

AutoX.js v7 public docs describe:

- normal `.js` files use the first-generation Rhino engine by default.
- `.mjs`, `.cjs`, and `.node.js` files use the Node engine.
- `.mjs` enables ESM and is described as the recommended Node route.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- `"nodejs";` and `"node";` route to the Node backend.
- `.node.js`, `.cjs`, and `.mjs` route to the Node backend.
- `.mjs` runs through the stable Node Profile v1.2 partial ESM path by default.
- CommonJS `require()` can load synchronous partial ESM graphs and rejects async
  ESM graphs with `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`.

Porting note: use `.cjs` or `"nodejs";` plus CommonJS `require()` when you need the widest AutoJs6 compatibility.

## Module Style

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs describe module usage through `require()` for Pro 9 modules and Node builtins.

AutoX.js v7 public docs describe second-generation APIs as import-first and state that `require()` and dynamic `import()` are not supported there at the time of the referenced docs.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- CommonJS `require()` is the primary supported module system.
- package `main`, `exports`, `imports`, self-reference, scoped packages, and JSON modules are supported within the Safe Node Profile.
- ESM static import is partially supported from `.mjs` and `type=module` entries.
- Local-only dynamic import is partially supported for relative modules,
  allowed builtins, and scoped packages.

Porting note:

```js
// Pro-style CommonJS is closest to AutoJs6 today.
const { showToast } = require("toast");
```

AutoX v7 import-first code usually needs to be rewritten to CommonJS for AutoJs6:

```js
// AutoX v7 style
import { showToast } from "toast";

// AutoJs6 Safe Node Profile style
const { showToast } = require("toast");
```

## npm And Builtins

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs present a broader Node/npm user experience, including npm installation guidance and examples using Node builtins such as `fs`, `http`, `https`, and `worker_threads`.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- pure JavaScript CommonJS packages are the primary compatibility target.
- checked-in `node_modules` package trees are supported.
- `npm install`, postinstall scripts, and native addon installation are not supported by the Safe Node Profile.
- native `dns`, `dns/promises`, `http`, `https`, `net`, and `tls`
  are stable and enabled; `dgram` remains denied.
- bounded runnable `worker_threads` is stable and enabled.
- native `.node` addons remain disabled by default.

P13-39 records native addon loading as partial. AutoJs6 now reports
`nativeAddonProfile` diagnostics, but this does not enable `.node` imports,
`process.dlopen`, native builds, or runtime download-exec. Future Desktop
support still requires signed packaged artifacts, ABI/hash allowlists,
dependency scan, and crash isolation.

Porting note: vendor pure-JS dependencies into the project, avoid install-time scripts, and check `docs/nodejs/COMPATIBILITY_PROFILE.md` for supported builtins.

## Filesystem

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs show Node `fs` examples that read Android absolute paths.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- `fs` and `fs/promises` are scoped to the working directory/project root.
- absolute paths are allowed only when they resolve inside the scoped root.
- `..` escape, NUL paths, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, symlink escape, and realpath escape are denied.
- file URL behavior is constrained by the scoped file URL policy.

Porting note:

```js
// Avoid this in AutoJs6 Node:
fs.readFile("/sdcard/scripts/test.txt", "utf8", callback);

// Prefer scoped project paths:
fs.readFile("data/test.txt", "utf8", callback);
```

## AutoJs API Bridge

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs describe migrated Pro modules such as `app`, `accessibility`, `image`, and `media_projection`, with many operations modeled as asynchronous Promise APIs.

AutoX.js v7 public docs also describe Promise and async-function direction for second-generation APIs.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- Android and AutoJs APIs are exposed through asynchronous bridge modules.
- Node scripts do not receive raw Android objects or unrestricted Java access by default.
- bridge calls are routed through capability providers and have timeout/destroy handling.
- returned UI nodes and image values are serialized snapshots or handles, not raw Java object references.

Current user-facing bridge modules include:

- `toast`
- `app`
- `dialogs`
- `engines`
- `accessibility`
- `media_projection`
- `image` / `images`
- `clipboard`
- `device`
- `ui`
- `ui.overlay`
- `shell`
- stable controlled `fetch` with declared network permission

Some modules are intentionally narrower than Pro/AutoX counterparts.

## Screenshot, Image, And OCR

P13-20 records screenshot/image/OCR as partial. AutoJs6 has the direct
`media_projection`, `image`/`images`, and `ocr` API shapes plus explicit
`autojs6:compat` wrappers for Rhino-style screenshot, image, and OCR code.
Scoped `image.readImage()`/`recycle()` and ML Kit OCR over provider-owned image
handles are live. Bridge-owned MediaProjection prompting, advanced image save
or transform operations, template/color search, packaged capture/OCR behavior,
and packaged disclosure evidence are still blocked. Paddle/Rapid/plugin OCR
provider selection and raw Bitmap/OpenCV/MediaProjection object parity stay
stable-denied for P13-20 v1.1.

## Accessibility And Selector

Auto.js Pro and Rhino scripts commonly rely on global selector builders such as
`text()`, `id()`, `desc()`, chained selector handles, global actions, and
gesture helpers.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- P13-19 records selector/accessibility as partial.
- `require("accessibility")` exposes JSON selector builders, `findOne`,
  `findAll`, selector `click`, `longClick`, `setText`, `scrollForward`,
  `scrollBackward`, `findByText`, `clickText`, `back`, `home`, and
  `recentApps`.
- `require("autojs6:compat")` exposes Promise-based Rhino-style selector
  handles, including `findOne(1000)`, `find()`, `findAll()`, `exists()`,
  selector actions, coordinate `click`, and Back/Home/Recents wrappers.
- Returned nodes are frozen JSON snapshots, not raw `AccessibilityNodeInfo` or
  Rhino/UiAutomator node objects.
- Direct `waitFor`, `pickup`, selector-style `detect`, `existsAll`, and
  `existsOne` stay stable-denied for P13-19 v1.1.
- `swipe`, `gesture`, `powerDialog`, packaged accessibility-service lifecycle,
  and root/Shizuku automation tiers remain unpromoted.

Porting note: use explicit `await` with direct `accessibility` or
`autojs6:compat` selector calls. Keep scripts that require synchronous Rhino
selector behavior, raw node objects, or gesture/root/Shizuku fallback on Rhino
until a later provider gate lands.

## UI

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs describe `"nodejs ui"` / `"ui-thread"` style entry
semantics.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- P13-11 records the entry directive metadata path, but it does not yet make
  Pro-style UI-thread execution equivalent.
- P13-17 records the live `require("ui")` provider promotion gate: JSON
  layout, update, event drain, close, provider cleanup, and Back/Recents
  lifecycle have live Activity evidence.
- `require("autojs6:compat").ui` maps to the same JSON-only provider for Rhino
  migration.
- packaged entry/update/close smoke is covered, while task relaunch, crash
  recovery, and packaged disclosure evidence remain unpromoted; configuration
  changes use an explicit
  destroy/recreate policy with no live UI survival claim.
- packaged missing-`ui` capability metadata rejects before dispatch.

Porting note: migrate Rhino UI scripts to explicit `require("ui")` or
`compat.ui` JSON descriptors instead of relying on raw `View`, `NativeView`,
`ui.run()`, `ui.post()`, or implicit current-Activity behavior.

## Floaty And Overlay

Auto.js Pro and AutoX scripts commonly use Rhino `floaty.window()` /
`floaty.rawWindow()` and overlay permission helpers.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- P13-18 records the partial `ui.overlay` provider promotion gate over the
  P12-14 Android live gate.
- `require("ui.overlay")` has JSON-only facade/types for `show`, `update`,
  `drainEvents`, `close`, `closeAll`, `hasPermission`, and
  `openPermissionSettings`.
- `hasPermission`, `openPermissionSettings`, and `closeAll` have Android
  permission/settings/cleanup live-gate evidence.
- packaged missing-`ui.overlay` capability and missing `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`
  metadata denial are covered before dispatch.
- live `show`, `update`, `drainEvents`, and per-handle `close` still fail
  closed until a real Android overlay provider, foreground disclosure,
  positive packaged install-run behavior, and leak/stress evidence land.
- `require("floaty")`, `compat.floaty`, global `floaty`, and exact Rhino raw
  `floaty.window()` / `floaty.rawWindow()` View parity remain unavailable.

Porting note: use `ui.overlay` only for JSON-only overlay migration
prototypes. Production scripts should not depend on live overlay windows until
the provider is promoted.

## Tasks And User Task Database

P13-21 records task database provider promotion as partial. AutoJs6 Node has
live `work_manager` scheduling for Node-owned scoped entries and
`require("autojs6:compat").tasks` one-shot disposable-task migration over that
provider, plus JSON-safe legacy `TimedTask` query/get snapshots for migration
evidence. It still does not expose direct `require("tasks")`, global `tasks`,
daily/weekly wall-clock task database mutation operations,
IntentTask/broadcast task provider access, packaged task database promotion, or
raw Rhino task object mutation.

P13-22 records IntentTask/broadcast provider promotion as partial. The
Android/Rhino `IntentTask` database and receiver stack are present, and the
Node `compat.tasks` IntentTask helpers keep stable unsupported errors. AutoJs6
Node still cannot register Android receivers, receive boot/package/custom
broadcast triggers, mutate packaged manifests, inspect raw trigger payloads, or
access raw `Intent` / `BroadcastReceiver` objects. For v1.1 these compat names
remain Promise-returning stable rejection stubs until a dedicated JSON-safe
broadcast provider owns the future surface. Packaged denial/boundary smoke now
covers those stable rejection stubs, future `tasks.*` module absence, raw
broadcast global absence, and future task/broadcast capability denial; positive
packaged trigger/remove behavior remains future provider work.

P13-23 records bounded app/intent/broadcast Pro parity as ready. AutoJs6 Node now has
JSON-safe `app.intent()` descriptors and stricter `app.startActivity()`
descriptor parsing for `category`/`categories`, numeric flag arrays, and
primitive extras, plus URL/email/settings/uninstall helpers, exact `app.query`
installed-app lookups, scoped file view/edit helpers, `app.launch()` alias
parity, and JSON-safe `app.parseUri()` descriptors. It keeps
`app.getUriForFile()`, `app.kill()`, dual-user helpers, and
`app.sendBroadcast()` as stable denials for P13-23 v1.1. Future raw
URI/FileProvider, root/Shizuku/dual-user, and broadcast authority belongs under
P13-22/P13-24 gates, while raw installed-app list APIs and raw Android
app/intent objects remain future-provider work. Packaged scoped-file Activity
routing is covered by the focused packaged app bridge smoke.

P13-24 records bounded shell/root/Shizuku capability closure. AutoJs6 Node now
has explicit `shell`, `shell.root`, and `shell.shizuku` capability tokens,
`shell.execRoot()` / `compat.shell.execRoot()` facades for the existing
controlled root shell path, and stable pre-dispatch Shizuku rejection. Real
Shizuku execution stays stable-denied for v1.1 until a dedicated provider owns
authorization prompts, lifecycle cleanup, packaged disclosure, rollback, and
device matrix evidence.

P13-25 records notifications/settings/power manager promotion as partial.
AutoJs6 Node now has JSON-safe notification permission/settings snapshots and
battery-optimization status/settings dry-run helpers through exact
`notifications.settings` and `device.power` boundaries. Keep Rhino/Pro scripts
that depend on notification actions/listeners, rich layouts, Do-Not-Disturb,
exact alarms, wakelocks, or direct power-manager control on Rhino because those
paths are stable-denied for v1.1. Packaged metadata/install-run,
notification action-or-permission-denial, settings/power dry-run, and
exact-denial smoke, rollback diagnostics, and the `notifications-power` Pro
migration example are covered. OEM power behavior, background-launch behavior,
and foreground disclosure UX remain future evidence.

P13-26 records media/recorder/mediainfo provider promotion as partial. AutoJs6
Node now has read-only audio stream snapshots, scoped file metadata through
`mediainfo`, and recorder status behind exact `media.audio`, `media.metadata`,
and `media.recording` boundaries. Keep Rhino/Pro scripts that depend on audio
playback, MediaStore access, or raw Android media objects on Rhino because
those paths are stable-denied for v1.1. Packaged bundled-asset lookup,
recorder status, recorder start denial, exact-denial smoke, recorder privacy
copy, and the `media-recorder` Pro migration example are covered. Real
recording sessions, foreground microphone disclosure/cleanup, and broader
corpus evidence remain future evidence.

P13-27 records utility-heavy Rhino modules promotion as partial. AutoJs6 Node
now exposes pure `jsox.mathx`, `jsox.arrayx`, and `jsox.numberx` helpers
through `require("jsox")`, direct submodule requires, and
`require("autojs6:compat").jsox`. Keep Rhino/Pro scripts that depend on
default global `Math`/prototype mutation, `zip`, `canvas`, OpenCC/pinyin
packaged dictionaries, `sysprops`, or raw Android/OpenCV objects on Rhino until
separate gates land.

P13-29 closes the controlled HTTP/HTTPS client subset for v1.1. AutoJs6 Node
supports the controlled `http`/`https` client facade for request/get, stream
response, timeout, redirect, provider-owned TLS errors, live Android/OkHttp
loopback fetch/axios/`http.get()` evidence, and packaged `network` to
`android.permission.INTERNET` metadata proof, but still rejects server/listen,
raw sockets, proxy/tunnel options, `CONNECT`, custom TLS/session control, and
per-request proxy configuration.

P13-30 records net/tls/dns staged compatibility as ready for the v1.1 limited-facade decision. AutoJs6 Node now
keeps `net`, `tls`, `dns`, and `dns/promises` reserved and typed for package
probing, `SocketAddress`, `BlockList`, TLS metadata, and deterministic
loopback/IP-literal DNS lookup. Keep Pro/AutoX scripts that depend on real TCP
or TLS sockets, server listeners, Android resolver state, custom DNS servers,
TLS sessions, fd handles, or live network DNS on Rhino/Android APIs until a
future Desktop-profile gate explicitly promotes those capabilities.

P13-31 records dgram UDP capability as stable-denied. AutoJs6 Node does not
provide `require("dgram")` or `require("node:dgram")` in the current v1.1
Desktop track. Keep Pro/AutoX scripts that depend on UDP send/receive, UDP
server bind/listen, multicast, broadcast, or raw datagram sockets on
Rhino/Android APIs until a future UDP provider and packaged permission policy
land.

P13-32 records filesystem profile expansion as partial. AutoJs6 Node still
keeps `fs` and `fs/promises` scoped to the script working directory by default;
`autojs6:profile.filesystemProfile` is diagnostic-only and reports no extra
roots. Keep Pro/AutoX scripts that depend on `/sdcard`, SAF/document trees,
user-selected directories, app-private shared roots, or broad Android storage
on Rhino/Android APIs until a future explicit filesystem root provider lands.

P13-33 records desktop fs advanced APIs as partial. AutoJs6 Node can already
exercise scoped streams, `FileHandle`, fd APIs, `opendir`, watchers, and
`realpath` in focused tests, and `filesystemProfile.advancedApis` reports that
state. Scripts should still treat these as scoped compatibility APIs: raw native
fd access, recursive watchers, expanded roots, and full packaged
watcher/fd/FileHandle lifecycle parity are not yet Pro/Desktop-promoted.

P13-34 is archived promotion evidence. Current AutoJs6 Node exposes stable
native `worker_threads` through both bare and `node:` names. Workers remain
pure-JavaScript compute isolates: they cannot call AutoJs bridge modules or use
raw Android objects, nested workers remain denied, and message, worker-count,
memory, timeout, cleanup, and packaged runtime-kit policy still applies.

P13-35 records the historical process-worker replacement decision. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`processWorkerReplacementProfile` diagnostics to show that WorkerPool is the
current replacement path, but it does not add `process_worker` or
`compute_worker` facades. Native `child_process` is now a separate stable
builtin. Scripts that need old shared threading/process-worker
semantics should remain on Rhino or explicit bridge-backed alternatives until a
future profile promotes them. For v1.1 there is no user-facing process-worker
API or UX, and any scoped `child_process` runner remains a separate P13-40
track.

P14-32 records an older planning decision superseded by
`worker_threads_stable_enabled_v1_2`. Bounded runnable/packaged workers and
native `child_process` are current runtime claims; separate process-worker
facades remain absent.

P13-40 records the historical scoped-runner plan. Current builds route
`child_process` and `node:child_process` to Node's native builtin before local
shadow packages. It follows Android sandbox and caller-managed executable,
timeout, stdio, cancellation, and cleanup policy. The controlled `shell`
bridge remains a separate capability provider.

P13-41 records ESM loader parity as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`esmLoaderProfile` diagnostics for the current AutoJs6-managed ESM subset:
`.mjs`, `type=module`, TLA, local static/dynamic import, package
`exports`/`imports`, simple re-export syntax, object/array destructuring
declaration exports and local `createRequire()` declarations used by package
entrypoints such as `css-tree`, keyword property names inside default-exported
object literals, JSON import attributes, scoped `import.meta`, and CJS interop.
It does not enable raw loader hooks,
network/file/unrestricted URL imports, import maps, custom condition profiles,
or broad packaged encrypted ESM graphs. Controlled JavaScript/JSON `data:` URL
imports are partial evidence only.

P13-42 records Android package manager parity as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`packageManagerProfile` diagnostics for the current host-managed package
manager plus Android local-store substrate. Pure JavaScript dependencies can be
prepared by host tooling and stored through the internal app-private Android
store, but Android npm CLI, registry download, remote tarball install, lifecycle scripts, bin shims,
symlinks, native builds/native payloads, and postinstall downloads remain
unavailable. `package_manager` is available as a guarded local mutation plus
read-maintenance and policy-only source planning facade for
status/policy/sourcePolicy/planInstall/planUpdate/planRemove/planRegistryInstall/planTarballInstall/install/update/remove/list/verify/prune;
mutating calls require `package_manager.mutate`, `allowMutation: true`, and
dry-run SHA-512 integrity. Remote source plan calls return `blocked_by_policy`
without network/cache access or install authority; registry plans can parse
caller-provided npm `metadata`/`packument` as frozen dist-tag/semver/integrity
diagnostics, and tarball plans can parse URL/name/version/sha512 shape locally.
`npm` is script-visible only as a guarded alias over that facade; CLI, registry
install, lifecycle, publish, and pack entry points remain stable-denied.

P13-43 records Node stdlib conformance as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`stdlibProfile` diagnostics for representative Safe stdlib coverage across
`crypto`, streams, zlib, Buffer, URL, OS, readline, TTY, `perf_hooks`, and
`async_hooks`. Controlled `process.getBuiltinModule` returns the same limited
wrappers as `require()`. Desktop packages that need broader OS/terminal
behavior, raw `process.getBuiltinModule` bypass behavior, `zlib/promises`,
unrestricted network/native handles, or full Node stdlib parity still need
later Desktop-profile work. The current stdlib corpus marker is
`real_npm_phase13_60_fixture_corpus`.

P13-44 records process/env/argv parity as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`processParityProfile` diagnostics for controlled `process.env`,
string-coercing script-local env writes, filtered sensitive env variables,
scoped cwd/chdir, argv metadata, `exitCode`, versions, timing/resource
snapshots, permission/report facades, and bounded stdio. `process.exit(code)`
maps to the embedded-script lifecycle
without native process termination. Desktop packages that need native/raw
process exit, signal delivery, inherited host env, raw process handles, native
bindings, `process.dlopen`, or report file writes still need later
Desktop-profile work.

P13-45 records packaged APK capability metadata as partial. AutoJs6 Node
exposes `packagedCapabilityProfile` and typed
`bridgePermissions.packagedMetadata` diagnostics for packaged profile,
permissions, builtins, native assets, filesystem roots, execution mode, and
network intent. These fields do not yet grant Pro/Desktop authority; they
prepare reviewed packaged synthesis while undeclared bridge capabilities still
reject before dispatch.

P13-46 records plugin system parity as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`pluginSystemProfile` diagnostics for the JS-only local plugin manager,
install/load/lifecycle operations, host capability ceiling, packaged local-file
status, and debug-only reload. Android provider plugins, native plugins,
signed archives, remote marketplace install/update, packaged plugin
distribution, and plugin-granted host authority remain unavailable.

P13-47 records dependency compatibility corpus as partial. AutoJs6 Node now
classifies the fixed real npm corpus with `phase13Compatibility` package reason
categories for `missing_builtin`, `native_addon`, `postinstall`, `network`,
and `fs`, plus stdlib +5 and ESM/network/fs/package-manager targeted deltas;
the differential report can show pass-rate rows by category when AutoJs6
results are supplied.
Unsafe registry packages, native payloads, lifecycle scripts, and postinstall
downloads remain blocked.

P13-48 records package lock and integrity policy as partial. AutoJs6 Node
exposes `packageIntegrityProfile` diagnostics for shared lockfile/hash/signature
policy across Android package manager, plugin packages, and native addon
artifacts. Android local-store rollback/prune/corruption recovery is covered,
but signed plugin archives, marketplace cache/update flows, and user-facing
corruption recovery remain unavailable. Signed native artifact verification is
delegated to the P13-39 packaged native path; P13-48 keeps native addon
integrity diagnostics fail-closed until that path exists.

P13-49 records profile selection UX and diagnostics as partial. AutoJs6 Node
exposes `profileSelection` diagnostics through `autojs6:profile` and Node
Doctor so Pro/AutoX migrations can see requested profiles, declared high-risk
capabilities, Android permission synthesis, and blocked promotions. Missing
bridge capability errors now report the required profile, Node capability, and
Android permissions, but effective authority remains `safe_default`. Effective
Pro/Desktop/Debug profile switching stays stable-denied for P13-49 v1.1.

P13-50 records relaxed-capability security corpus closeout. AutoJs6 Node now
tracks raw network, filesystem relaxation, Java interop, `child_process`,
native addon loading, inspector, and WASI in
`RELAXED_CAPABILITY_SECURITY_CORPUS.json`, with positive tests, negative tests,
abuse cases, CI evidence, runtime guards, promotion preconditions, and rollback
posture. This helps Pro/AutoX migration planning without enabling raw sockets,
expanded roots, raw process/native handles, raw WASI, inspector, native addons,
or release Java interop.

P13-51 records per-profile rollback playbook as partial. AutoJs6 Node now
exposes `profileRollbackPolicy` diagnostics and Node Doctor rollback output
for default-off Pro/Desktop/Debug profile switches, relaxed-capability
rollback actions, Safe crash/stress fallback, and packaged APK Safe-profile
downgrade guidance. The playbook helps staged Pro/AutoX compatibility work
remain reversible; it does not enable profile authority by itself. Runtime
rollback wiring and automatic crash circuit breaker implementation are
deferred until effective profile switching is promoted.

P13-52 records privacy and disclosure policy as partial. AutoJs6 Node now
exposes `privacyDisclosurePolicy` diagnostics and Node Doctor privacy
disclosure output for prompt channels, foreground disclosure requirements,
Android permission/settings metadata, and packaged denial behavior across
screenshot, recording, overlay, accessibility, network, filesystem
relaxation, Java interop, root/Shizuku shell, `child_process`, native addon,
inspector, and WASI. This blocks implicit high privilege while prompt UI,
notification ownership, and packaged disclosure review remain future work.

P13-36 records `vm` module promotion as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`vmProfile` diagnostics and now routes `vm` / `node:vm` to Node's native VM
builtin. `vm.Script`, contexts, `compileFunction`, VM module APIs, and native
timeout options are available for npm compatibility. This is not a sandbox
boundary; P13-36 focused evidence now covers repeated compiled-script budgets,
native timeout interruption, VM boundary probes, and packaged fixture behavior.

P13-37 records inspector/devtools debug profile as partial. AutoJs6 Node
exposes `inspectorProfile` diagnostics, but `inspector`, `node:inspector`,
DevTools attach, debugger URLs, CPU profiles, heap snapshots, and inspector
profiling exports remain unavailable. Scripts that depend on desktop debugging
workflows still need a future debug-only profile with explicit user action,
loopback ADB forwarding, artifact redaction, and packaged behavior evidence.

P13-38 records controlled WASI profile as partial. AutoJs6 Node exposes
`wasiProfile` diagnostics, and pure WebAssembly remains available, but raw
`wasi`, `node:wasi`, controlled preopens, WASI fd/env/args surfaces, and
packaged WASI behavior remain unavailable. For P13-38 v1.1, pure WebAssembly is
the supported runtime path and raw/controlled WASI APIs stay stable-denied.
Packages that require desktop WASI
still need a future controlled profile with scoped or user-authorized roots,
resource budgets, and escape-denial evidence.

P13-53 records Pro parity examples as partial. AutoJs6 Node now ships
`sample/nodejs/pro-parity-suite`, a guarded catalog for `$autojs.java`,
`rhino.install`, UI, floaty/overlay, tasks, screenshot/OCR, and accessibility
migration. The catalog records required capabilities, expected output,
packaged behavior, and skip reasons for unavailable providers or permissions.
A focused runtime smoke subset runs Activity-owned UI layout and WorkManager
one-shot schedule/cancel behavior; high-risk Pro snippets remain documentation
and static-verification evidence only, are not part of default runtime smoke,
and do not grant Pro profile authority.

P13-54 records desktop Node parity examples as partial. AutoJs6 Node now ships
`sample/nodejs/desktop-parity-suite`, a guarded catalog for ESM,
`worker_threads`, HTTP/HTTPS, raw network, advanced fs, WASI, inspector, and
sanitized pure JavaScript npm dependency migration. The catalog records `desktop_compat_opt_in`,
required capabilities, expected output, stable-capability and denial output,
packaged behavior, and platform failure notes. A focused runtime smoke subset runs managed local
ESM, controlled HTTP/HTTPS facade shape without live network I/O, the checked-in
pure JavaScript dependency path, and scoped advanced fs FileHandle/watch
behavior; high-risk desktop
WASI/Inspector/expanded-fs snippets remain documentation and static-verification evidence only, are not
part of default runtime smoke, and do not grant Desktop profile authority.

P13-55 records TypeScript profile declarations as partial. AutoJs6 Node now
ships `profile_capabilities.d.ts`, a declaration-only matrix for
Safe/Pro/Desktop/Debug profile differences across the P13-53 and P13-54
surfaces, including stable worker, Java, ESM, HTTP/HTTPS, raw supported network,
and child-process rows. Scripts can type-check stable and gated behavior with
`ProfileModuleModeFor` and related helpers, but denied desktop modules are not
declared as callable modules and no Pro/Desktop authority is granted by the
declaration package.

P13-56 records migration and Pro9 comparison docs as partial. Existing
AutoJs/Rhino bridge modules and covered `autojs6:compat` wrappers are the main
Pro-compatible migration lane. Local CJS/partial ESM, scoped filesystem,
controlled HTTP/HTTPS, stable native networking, workers, and host-managed
pure-JS dependencies are the main Desktop-compatible migration lane.
Allowlisted `$autojs.java`, `require("java")`, and explicit `rhino.install`
are stable; raw Java or
Android globals, raw floaty, unrestricted UI-thread execution, daily/weekly task
rows, expanded filesystem roots, `vm`, `inspector`, raw WASI, native addons,
Android npm CLI,
registry install, lifecycle scripts, and native payloads remain
gated/diagnostic-only or unsupported until a later profile promotion gate lands.

Porting note: migrate one-shot disposable task cases to `work_manager` or
`compat.tasks`. Keep Rhino scripts that depend on daily/weekly user task rows,
IntentTask triggers, or raw task object mutation on Rhino until a dedicated
Pro-profile task provider lands.

## Java And Android Interop

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs describe `$autojs.java` and a `rhino` module for Java/Android interop.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- allowlisted Java interop is stable in the default Node profile; unrestricted Java/Android object access is not.
- P13-12 provides `$autojs` global v1 as a read-only diagnostic and gated entry
  surface: `$autojs.androidContext` is not a raw `Context`, and `$autojs.java`
  routes through the stable, allowlist-only Java provider.
- P13-13 adds allowlist-only `java.lang.Math`,
  `java.util.UUID`, and `android.graphics.Rect` handle construction, selected
  instance calls, field reads, and explicit release/dispose cleanup.
- P13-14 adds an explicit `rhino.install({ explicit: true })` Java proxy
  POC: `Packages`, `java`, and `android` can be installed only when the Java
  interop provider is available, and all calls still route through the same
  allowlist. Default `rhino.install()` remains rejected.
- P13-15 keeps Rhino `importClass` / `importPackage` semantics unsupported in
  Node. Explicit `require("rhino").importClass()` / `.importPackage()` calls
  throw `ERR_AUTOJS6_RHINO_IMPORT_UNSUPPORTED`; assign local names from a
  P13-14 proxy target instead.
- P13-16 keeps Rhino `JavaAdapter` unsupported in Node. Explicit
  `require("rhino").JavaAdapter()` calls throw
  `ERR_AUTOJS6_RHINO_JAVA_ADAPTER_UNSUPPORTED`; `java.defineClass()` and
  `$autojs.java.defineClass()` are reserved replacement names but still throw
  `ERR_AUTOJS6_JAVA_METHOD_DENIED` until a bounded proxy-interface provider is
  implemented.
- AutoJs capabilities should be requested through bridge modules.
- raw Android services, activities, accessibility nodes, media projection objects, and bitmap pointers are not exposed directly.

Porting note: use `$autojs.java`, `require("java")`, or explicit
`rhino.install({ explicit: true, target })` only within the reviewed allowlist.
`importClass`, `JavaAdapter`, `defineClass`, reflection, class loading, native
loading, and raw Android objects remain unsupported. Prefer explicit bridge
APIs for Android capabilities.

## Threads

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs describe Node's event-loop model, state that old `threads` style is not available in Node scripts, and describe `worker_threads` with restrictions around Auto.js APIs.

AutoX.js v7 public docs also describe replacing Node-engine multithreading with Promise and asynchronous functions.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- Rhino `threads` APIs are not available in Node scripts.
- native `worker_threads` is stable for isolated pure-JavaScript compute work,
  with bridge/Android-object denial and resource/lifecycle budgets.
- background Android work should still use Promise-based APIs, bridge
  providers, `work_manager`, or explicit engine execution slots.

Porting note: convert threaded Rhino code to `async` / `await` and bridge calls.

## Network

Auto.js Pro 9 public docs list `http` and `https` as usable Node builtins.

AutoJs6 behavior:

- native Node `http`, `https`, `net`, `tls`, `dns`, and `dns/promises` are
  stable and enabled by default; `dgram` remains disabled.
- controlled `fetch`, axios/undici compatibility, and WebSocket are stable
  bridge-backed surfaces with host permissions and budgets.
- packaged network use requires Android `INTERNET`; native builtins do not
  inherit controlled-provider per-request budgets.

Porting note: supported Node socket and HTTP builtins are stable in the current profile. Prefer the controlled network facade when host-enforced permissions, budgets, cancellation, and audit metadata are required; native builtins require script-owned limits and cleanup.

## Packaged APKs

AutoJs6 packaged Node APK support is a first-class target, but it is tied to the Safe Node Profile:

- native libraries must be present for selected ABIs.
- `NativeNodeEmbeddedScriptService` must be declared.
- foreground service permissions and `specialUse` metadata are verified.
- module sources and encrypted Node entries are checked by packaged diagnostics.
- `nodeFull`, `nodeMini`, and `rhinoOnly` release flavor policy is enforced.

Porting note: a Pro/AutoX Node script that runs in its original environment may still fail packaged AutoJs6 verification if it depends on unsupported builtins, unrestricted fs, native addons, raw network, full desktop ESM loader behavior, or dynamic import.

## Phase 14 v1.2 Migration Claim Sync

P14-36 records v1.2 migration and Pro comparison docs as ready. These migration
claims match executable evidence and do not imply raw Android object parity.

The v1.2 compatibility status is:

- Pro UI and floaty: controlled UI evidence exists, but overlay/floaty remains
  `provider_poc_not_promoted` until permission, disclosure, packaged, and
  device-matrix gates pass.
- accessibility: selector/action types and examples are migration evidence;
  service-enabled and Android 12/15+ archives remain future evidence.
- screenshot/OCR: OCR/image-handle migration evidence exists, while
  MediaProjection capture, advanced live image operations, and raw bitmap
  access remain gated.
- tasks: `work_manager` and one-shot `compat.tasks` remain the supported
  migration path; task database mutation, IntentTask/broadcast rows, wall-clock
  parity, and raw task objects remain future-only.
- notifications: owned status/settings helpers are migration evidence;
  packaged post/cancel and OEM behavior require future archives.
- recorder: status and denial-oriented examples are migration evidence; real
  recording sessions and packaged recorder stress remain future-only.
- worker/process policy: bounded runnable/packaged workers and native
  `child_process` are stable; separate process-worker facades are absent.
- packaged behavior: P14-34 records `host_contract_ready`, a deterministic host
  contract rather than a real device install-run archive claim.
- rollback: Safe downgrade, packaged metadata mismatch, profile rollback, and
  provider disable policy remain part of the required evidence chain.

`NodeProfileV12CapabilityCatalog` is metadata-only and runtime authority
remains unchanged.
runtime authority remains unchanged.

Do not treat Auto.js Pro or AutoX object wrappers as raw Node parity. AutoJs6
v1.2 does not expose raw `Context`, raw `Activity`, raw `View`, raw `Bitmap`,
raw `Intent`, raw `MediaProjection`, raw `MediaRecorder`, raw `TimedTask`, raw
`BroadcastReceiver`, raw `Notification`, or raw `WakeLock` objects.
AutoJs6 v1.2 does not expose raw `BroadcastReceiver` objects.

## Quick Porting Matrix

| Behavior | Auto.js Pro 9 docs | AutoX.js v7 docs | AutoJs6 Safe Node Profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Default `.js` engine | Rhino | Rhino | Rhino compatibility preserved |
| Node directive | `"nodejs";` | suffix-focused docs | `"nodejs";` / `"node";` |
| `.mjs` | Node + ESM | Node + ESM | Stable scoped ESM |
| Main module style | `require()` | `import` | CommonJS and scoped ESM |
| Dynamic import | not the AutoJs6 target | documented as unsupported | stable for scoped local/package/data imports |
| npm install | documented user workflow | not the AutoJs6 target | unsupported |
| Pure-JS CJS packages | broad npm-oriented docs | not equivalent | supported target |
| Scoped fs | not described as AutoJs6 policy | not equivalent | enforced |
| Raw `http`/`https` | documented as usable | not equivalent | stable native builtins inside Android sandbox |
| `worker_threads` | documented with Auto.js API restrictions | no old-style multithreading | stable native workers with bridge isolation and budgets |
| `tasks` / user task database | timed task database APIs | compatibility varies | P13-21 partial: `work_manager` and one-shot `compat.tasks` only |
| Direct Java/Android access | `$autojs` / `rhino` docs | Java Promise direction | stable exact allowlist; raw Android/JVM objects denied |
| Packaged APK Node runtime | product-specific | product-specific | verified Safe Node Profile |

## Recommended Adaptation Steps

1. Convert entry files to `.cjs` or add `"nodejs";`.
2. Keep scoped ESM/import-first code where supported; remove raw loader hooks,
   network imports, absolute/file URL escapes, or custom loader authority.
3. Vendor pure-JS dependencies instead of relying on `npm install`.
4. Replace absolute filesystem paths with scoped project-relative paths.
5. Choose controlled networking for host-enforced budgets, or apply explicit
   caller-owned limits and cleanup when using stable native networking.
6. Keep Java calls inside the exact stable allowlist and replace raw Android
   access with AutoJs6 bridge modules.
7. Replace shared Rhino threads with Promise-based control flow or stable,
   isolated `worker_threads` compute workers.
8. Run `NodeSecurityRegressionInstrumentationTest` when changing compatibility assumptions.
9. Run packaged APK diagnostics when packaging adapted scripts.

## Phase 15 v1.3 Migration And Pro Comparison

P15-26 records v1.3 migration and Pro comparison docs as ready. These claims
match executable evidence and do not imply raw Android object parity. The v1.3
Pro/AutoX compatibility state has no newly promoted providers, and runtime
authority remains unchanged.

The v1.3 compatibility status is:

- Pro UI and floaty: live UI and overlay remain `provider_poc_not_promoted`
  until device, disclosure, cleanup, packaged, security, TypeScript
  declarations, migration, and rollback evidence pass.
- accessibility: selector/action and guarded examples remain migration
  evidence; service-enabled device archives, disclosure, security corpus,
  packaged behavior, and rollback evidence are still required.
- screenshot/OCR: MediaProjection and image/OCR remain
  `provider_poc_not_promoted`; capture, raw image handles, OCR provider modes,
  and packaged OCR claims stay tied to executable evidence.
- tasks: task database, schema migration, packaged task scheduling, and
  IntentTask/broadcast remain `provider_poc_not_promoted`.
- notifications: notification ownership and settings/power remain
  `provider_poc_not_promoted`.
- recorder: recorder sessions and packaged recorder stress remain
  `provider_poc_not_promoted`.
- MediaStore/playback: playback, playlists, MediaStore query/mutation, broad
  media permissions, and raw media handles remain `stable_denied`.
- security corpus: P15-23 is
  `security_corpus_updated_no_authority_promoted`.
- packaged behavior: P15-24 is `host_contract_ready`, not real device
  install-run release approval.
- TypeScript declarations: `NodeProfileV13CapabilityCatalog` is metadata-only.
- rollback: Safe downgrade, profile rollback, packaged metadata mismatch,
  provider disable flags, and compatibility claim rollback remain required.

No v1.3 Pro/AutoX compatibility row grants raw `Context`, raw `Activity`, raw
`View`, raw `Bitmap`, raw `Intent`, raw `MediaProjection`, raw `MediaRecorder`,
raw `TimedTask`, raw `BroadcastReceiver`, raw `Notification`, raw `WakeLock`,
raw `ContentResolver`, raw `MediaStore`, raw file descriptors, or Java objects.
